**Initial Proposal**
General idea: The question/problem are you interested in, the data you need to acquire, the variables you’ll use, and the plan for how you’ll analyze it (what methods you’ll try and why you think they apply to your problem), considerations about how data might impact that.

Treat this document as if it is public facing, and a proposal for which you would like funding. That is, the proposal document should be polished (both in visual formatting and editing) for external audiences.

Graded on: question viability, creativity, finance application, plan sketch, writing quality.

Instructions for the proposals are here.

**Final Proposal**
I will provide feedback on your proposals to help you “right size” your goal and avoid some potholes.

Graded on: The improvement from the prior version, how feedback was incorporated, and quality after revisions

**Repo**
On the due date (listed in the schedule), your repo should be cleaned and polished for publication. That means it should be cleaned of excess and random files, and that folders are sensible (data, temporary, code), the readme helps me/the TA/future visitors explore your repo easily. Your folder structure is up to you and will respond to the nature of your particular project, but I should be able to easily find

The readme should contain a link to the website built off this analysis

The code used to scrape and download data (and if you click-and-download anything, a link to the source) can be separate files, and the code used to load, clean, merge, and explore the data.

The code used to do the analysis

Your presentation file needs to be in this repo. If you use google slides, you should include them as a PDF in this folder / put a link to the slides in the readme.

Graded on: Folder org, read me, code readability/structure

Obvious caveats for grading: Form matters, check grammar, and cite work you build on. Plagiarism is not acceptable.*

**Website/Dashboard**
We will talk about this more later.

**Presentation**
I’ll discuss scheduling later.

You have 15 minutes

Everyone should contribute

There will be Q&A (from myself)

Teach your classmates and me something! Strive for clarity and try to make something about it memorable.

Method: You can present a powerpoint, a jupyter file, or jupyter slides (nice!). I’ll leave it up to your group to present in the manner you consider most effective for your project.

Time: Each group will have up to 15 minutes to present your project, so build your presentation file accordingly. Try to avoid “speed talking” to make the time work. Less is more, usually. Sadly, 15 minutes won’t be enough to show everything you did, so focus on big picture details rather than on the syntax of line 89 of your code.

Content: A presentation’s structure is tailored even more to its material than a report is, so what your slides show is up to you. Be creative, and have fun. Try to convey to me and your peers why the question is interesting, describe plainly your approach and why your approach makes sense, what your main analytical findings are, and what you concluded from the exercise. You can even show/use your website during your presentation if you want.

Enjoyment: Don’t be afraid to “market yourselves”! If you did something impressive (tons and tons of data, or an impressive scraper, or a great model), find a way to tastefully show your classmates (and me) the cool stuff you did!
